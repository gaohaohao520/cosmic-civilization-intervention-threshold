## Abstract
Addressing the core contradiction of the Fermi Paradox—"the universe is vast yet no extraterrestrial civilizations have been detected"—this paper proposes the original "Cosmic Civilization Intervention Threshold Theory". Taking "technological asymmetry determines the initiative of detection" as the premise, a dynamic logical chain of "stealth detection → threshold triggering → active exposure → rule establishment" is constructed through a three-level analogy model of "indigenous civilizations → modern humans → advanced extraterrestrial civilizations". The study argues that the default state of advanced civilizations towards lower-level civilizations is "non-intervention stealth observation"; only when the behaviors of lower-level civilizations break a specific "intervention threshold" (such as large-scale irreversible destruction or threats to civilization survival) will advanced civilizations take the initiative to expose themselves and establish basic rules. Its essence is the "ethical intervention" of advanced civilizations on lower-level civilizations, rather than passive observation or malicious destruction. This theory not only explains the current status of no contact with extraterrestrial civilizations but also fills the gap in existing theories regarding the "active intervention mechanism", providing a new perspective for the study of cosmic civilization contact.

## 1. Introduction
Since Fermi proposed the classic paradox of "why there are no traces of extraterrestrial civilizations in the universe" in 1950, the scientific community has formed three mainstream explanatory frameworks: the "Zoo Hypothesis" advocates that advanced civilizations adopt "complete non-intervention observation" of lower-level civilizations; the "Dark Forest Theory" emphasizes the malicious logic of "detection equals destruction"; and the "Great Filter Theory" focuses on internal obstacles to the evolution of civilizations themselves. These theories either fall into the static assumption of "absolute non-intervention" or exaggerate the danger of the universe, and none have explained the core question of "whether advanced civilizations have limited active intervention".

In reality, the interaction logic between humans and uncontacted indigenous civilizations provides an important reference: modern humans achieve "stealth detection" of indigenous peoples through technologies such as satellite observation, and only take the initiative to contact and establish rules when indigenous peoples engage in behaviors that cross ethical bottom lines (e.g., large-scale cannibalism, tribal massacres). This interaction model of "technological superiority → stealth observation → threshold triggering → ethical intervention" can be extended to the cosmic civilization scale.

Based on this, this paper integrates three core elements: "technological asymmetry", "ethical intervention", and "dynamic triggering mechanism", and proposes the "Cosmic Civilization Intervention Threshold Theory", aiming to break the binary opposition of existing theories and construct a more explanatory analytical framework for cosmic civilization contact.

## 2. Core Theoretical Framework
### 2.1 Theoretical Basis: Technological Asymmetry Determines the Initiative of Detection and Intervention
Differences in technological levels directly lead to an asymmetric pattern of "detection capability" and "detectability" between civilizations, forming a "one-way transparency" of advanced civilizations towards lower-level civilizations:
- The detection range of lower-level civilizations is limited by cognitive boundaries (e.g., indigenous peoples cannot identify high-altitude satellites);
- The detection technologies of advanced civilizations are beyond the cognitive scope of lower-level civilizations (e.g., humans observe indigenous peoples with satellites, and extraterrestrial civilizations may observe Earth with technologies not yet mastered by humans, such as gravitational waves and micro detectors);
- This "stealth" is not deliberate concealment, but the technological level of lower-level civilizations is unable to identify the detection methods of advanced civilizations, just as ants cannot perceive human observation.

### 2.2 Core Concept: Definition and Trigger Conditions of the Intervention Threshold
The "intervention threshold" is the critical standard set by advanced civilizations for "shifting from observation to intervention", with the core being whether the behaviors of lower-level civilizations violate the ethical bottom lines of advanced civilizations or cosmic order. The trigger conditions must meet two points:
1. Destructiveness: Directly threatening the survival of the lower-level civilization itself (e.g., global nuclear war, irreversible ecological collapse) or potential cosmic order (e.g., technological out-of-control may threaten other civilizations);
2. Irreversibility: Without intervention, the behavior will lead to irreversible consequences (e.g., civilization extinction, permanent collapse of planetary ecology).

Non-destructive behaviors (e.g., conventional technological exploration, small-scale internal conflicts) will not trigger intervention, and advanced civilizations will maintain the state of stealth observation.

### 2.3 Dynamic Logical Chain: A Complete Closed Loop from Observation to Rule Establishment
1. Initial State: Stealth Observation – Advanced civilizations conduct non-interfering observation of lower-level civilizations through technological superiority and collect evolutionary data;
2. Trigger Condition: Breaking the Intervention Threshold – The destructive behaviors of the lower-level civilization reach the critical standard;
3. Key Action: Active Exposure – Advanced civilizations appear in a way perceivable by lower-level civilizations (e.g., controllable technological demonstration);
4. Core Purpose: Rule Establishment – Formulating basic ethical norms (e.g., prohibiting large-scale destruction), which is essentially "ethical intervention";
5. Subsequent State: Limited Supervision – After the rules are established, there is no in-depth intervention in the evolution of the lower-level civilization, only a supervision mechanism is retained, and secondary intervention will be carried out if the threshold is broken again.

### 2.4 Three-Level Analogy Model: From Real Interaction to Cosmic Scale
| Civilization Level       | Technological Characteristics       | Interactive Behaviors               | Corresponding Cosmic Scenarios       |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Indigenous Civilizations | Primitive tools, hunting and gathering | Cannibalism (breaking the intervention threshold) | Human outbreak of global nuclear war |
| Modern Humans            | Aerospace technology, satellite detection | Active exposure + rule-making (prohibiting cannibalism) | Extraterrestrial civilizations taking the initiative to appear + establishing basic rules |
| Advanced Extraterrestrial Civilizations | Interstellar detection, space perception technology | Stealth observation + intervention after threshold triggering | Default observation and intervention mode for lower-level civilizations |

## 3. Comparison with Mainstream Theories
### 3.1 Differences from the "Zoo Hypothesis"
- The core of the Zoo Hypothesis is "complete non-intervention"; no matter what happens to the lower-level civilization, the advanced civilization maintains observation;
- The Intervention Threshold Theory advocates "limited ethical intervention", with non-intervention as the default, but takes the initiative to establish rules when the threshold is broken, which is more in line with the logic of "ethical responsibility of the technologically superior party".

### 3.2 Differences from the "Dark Forest Theory"
- The Dark Forest Theory is centered on "malice and fear", holding that the relationship between civilizations is a zero-sum game;
- The Intervention Threshold Theory is centered on "ethics and protection", holding that the intervention of advanced civilizations is essentially to maintain civilization survival and cosmic order, consistent with the logic of human protection of indigenous peoples.

### 3.3 Differences from the "Great Filter Theory"
- The Great Filter Theory focuses on internal obstacles to the civilization itself (e.g., nuclear war, AI out-of-control), without involving external intervention;
- The Intervention Threshold Theory supplements the "external intervention mechanism", holding that even if a lower-level civilization faces an internal crisis, it may avoid extinction through the intervention of advanced civilizations.

## 4. Practical Basis and Rationality Verification
### 4.1 Practical Basis: Human Interaction Practice with Indigenous Civilizations
- Stealth Observation: Humans record the lives of indigenous peoples through satellites, long-distance observation and other methods without active interference;
- Threshold Triggering: When indigenous peoples engage in behaviors that cross ethical bottom lines such as large-scale cannibalism and tribal massacres, humans take the initiative to contact and establish rules;
- Limited Intervention: After the rules are established, the culture and lifestyle of indigenous peoples are not forcibly changed, only the implementation of basic ethics is supervised, which confirms the core logic of "ethical intervention".

### 4.2 Rationality Verification: Explaining the Fermi Paradox
- Human behaviors have not yet broken the intervention threshold of advanced civilizations (no global irreversible destruction);
- The "stealth observation" method of advanced civilizations is beyond human technological cognition, leading to the inability to detect;
- If humans break the threshold in the future, the active exposure of extraterrestrial civilizations may become inevitable.

## 5. Discussion and Prospects
### 5.1 Theoretical Advantages
1. Originality: For the first time, "ethical intervention" and "dynamic triggering mechanism" are introduced into the study of cosmic civilizations, filling the gap in existing theories;
2. Practical Relevance: With the interaction between humans and indigenous peoples as empirical support, it avoids purely abstract assumptions and enhances persuasiveness;
3. Inclusiveness: It not only explains the status of "no contact" but also predicts the scenario of "future contact", taking into account both scientificity and readability.

### 5.2 Potential Controversies and Responses
1. Controversy: Are the ethical standards of advanced civilizations unified? Response: Civilizations that can develop to the level of interstellar detection must have resolved internal ethical conflicts (otherwise they will self-destruct). "Prohibiting irreversible destruction" is a basic consensus for civilization survival and has ethical consistency;
2. Controversy: How to define the specific standards of the intervention threshold? Response: The core is "irreversible destruction". The specific standards may have detailed differences due to the level of civilization, but "protecting civilization survival" is a common bottom line. There is no need to dwell on specific values, and the core is the dynamic triggering logic.

### 5.3 Future Research Directions
1. Combining SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) observation data to explore potential signals of intervention by advanced civilizations;
2. Simulating the "contact scenario after breaking the threshold" through thought experiments to refine the specific form of rule establishment;
3. Extending to the scenario of multi-civilization interaction to analyze the intervention coordination mechanism of multiple advanced civilizations on the same lower-level civilization.

## 6. Conclusion
The "Cosmic Civilization Intervention Threshold Theory", based on technological asymmetry and centered on ethical intervention, provides a new explanatory framework for the Fermi Paradox through the dynamic logical chain of "stealth observation → threshold triggering → active exposure → rule establishment". This theory breaks the binary opposition of existing theories of "either non-intervention or destruction", and proposes a new paradigm of "limited ethical intervention by advanced civilizations", which is not only consistent with the interactive reality between humans and indigenous civilizations but also has scientific self-consistency.

The current lack of contact between humans and extraterrestrial civilizations is essentially a natural result of "not breaking the intervention threshold". In the future, if human civilization can avoid irreversible destruction, it will continue to evolve independently; if the threshold is broken, the active contact of extraterrestrial civilizations may become inevitable. This theory not only provides academic reference for cosmic civilization exploration but also offers enlightenment for the sustainable development of human civilization—the coordination of technological progress and ethical improvement is the core guarantee for civilization survival.
