## Abstract
Based on the optimized Kardashev scale model (Kardashev, 1964) and ethical research on extraterrestrial contact (Dick, 2008), this paper breaks through the dichotomy between the "Zoo Hypothesis" (Ball, 1973) and the "Dark Forest Theory" (Liu, 2008), proposing a core theoretical framework of "Cosmic Civilization Intervention Threshold" with "technological asymmetry" as the premise and "ethical intervention" as the core. By quantifying the civilizational technological level (0-Ⅶ grades), defining the critical condition of "absolute technological asymmetry" (level difference ≥ 3), and constructing the static calculation formula of intervention threshold:

$$IT = \frac{DRV × EA}{CIC}$$

This paper explains the core logic of "stealth observation → threshold triggering → ethical intervention", filling the quantitative gap in extraterrestrial civilization intervention theory and providing a new analytical perspective for the research on cosmic civilization contact.

## 1. Introduction
The theory of extraterrestrial civilization contact has long been dominated by two extreme views: "complete non-intervention" (e.g., the Zoo Hypothesis) and "destruction upon discovery" (e.g., the Dark Forest Theory), lacking quantitative and mechanistic research on "limited intervention". In reality, human civilization's intervention in ecosystems (such as species protection) follows the "risk threshold" principle—intervention is only initiated when the ecosystem faces irreversible damage, a logic that can be extended to the cosmic civilization scale.

Based on this, this paper proposes the "Cosmic Civilization Intervention Threshold" theory, focusing on solving three core issues: how technological asymmetry affects intervention feasibility, what the triggering threshold of intervention behavior is, and what the implementation principles and methods of ethical intervention are. Through quantitative modeling and logical deduction, it provides a theoretical framework and quantitative basis for the intervention behavior of high-level civilizations towards low-level civilizations.

## 2. Core Theoretical Construction: Technological Asymmetry and Intervention Threshold
### 2.1 Technological Asymmetry: The Premise of Intervention
#### 2.1.1 Quantitative Optimization of Technological Levels
On the basis of Kardashev's Ⅰ-Ⅲ grade classification, this paper optimizes it into a refined 0-Ⅶ grade system, with "energy utilization efficiency", "spatial technology maturity", and "information processing capability" as core indicators:

| Technological Level | Core Characteristics | Energy Utilization Capability | Typical Technological Markers |
|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| TL-0                | Planetary Primitive Civilization | Utilizing natural energy on the planetary surface | Fire, tool manufacturing |
| TL-Ⅰ                | Planetary System Civilization | Fully utilizing planetary energy | Controlled nuclear fusion, interplanetary navigation |
| TL-Ⅱ                | Stellar System Civilization | Utilizing all energy of the star | Dyson Sphere, interstellar navigation |
| TL-Ⅲ                | Galactic Civilization | Utilizing core energy of the galaxy | Wormhole technology, intergalactic navigation |
| TL-Ⅳ and above      | Cosmic Civilization | Utilizing cosmic space/dark energy | Spatial curvature navigation, cosmic law modification |

#### 2.1.2 Critical Judgment of Absolute Technological Asymmetry
"Absolute technological asymmetry" is defined as a technological level difference ≥ 3 between civilizations, where high-level civilizations can achieve:
- Stealth observation: Collecting data through quantum entanglement detection, spatial curvature fluctuation monitoring, and other technologies without material/information interaction with low-level civilizations;
- Low-cost intervention: The marginal cost of intervention approaches zero, such as shielding dangerous technology R&D information through spatial curvature.

This critical value refers to the 200-year technological gap of human civilization (from the Industrial Revolution to the Information Revolution) and the theoretical limit of quantum detection technology (Hossenfelder, 2020).

### 2.2 Intervention Threshold: The Quantitative Trigger for Intervention
#### 2.2.1 Core Concept Definition
The Intervention Threshold (IT) is the critical condition for high-level civilizations to shift from "stealth observation" to "active ethical intervention", essentially the acceptable limit of development risks of low-level civilizations, consisting of three dimensions:
- Development Risk Value (DRV, 0-1): Covering technological explosion, internal conflict, and interstellar exposure risks, assigned using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Saaty, 1980);
- Ethical Acceptance (EA, 0-1): The matching degree between the ethical system of high-level civilizations and the development model of low-level civilizations;
- Cosmic Order Impact Coefficient (CIC, 0-1): The impact of low-level civilizations' development on cosmic order, with smaller CIC for lower-level civilizations (default 0.3 for TL-Ⅰ).

#### 2.2.2 Static Calculation Formula and Threshold
When $IT ≥ 0.7$, ethical intervention is initiated; when $IT < 0.7$, stealth observation is maintained. The threshold setting refers to the risk threshold of human civilization's intervention in ecosystems (IPCC, 2021).

### 2.3 Logic Chain: "Stealth Observation → Threshold Triggering → Ethical Intervention"
#### 2.3.1 Stealth Observation Phase
High-level civilizations collect data on low-level civilizations through a "non-contact detection system", with the core goal of dynamically monitoring DRV changes without interfering in their natural evolution.

#### 2.3.2 Typical Scenarios of Threshold Triggering
1. Technological explosion: Short-term cross-level technological breakthroughs (e.g., TL-Ⅰ civilizations mastering antimatter weapons), DRV≥0.8;
2. Civilizational internal consumption: Global nuclear war or ecological disasters, with civilization survival risk ≥0.9;
3. Interstellar exposure: Actively launching high-power directional interstellar signals containing coordinates and technical details (Shostak, 2010).

#### 2.3.3 Implementation Principles and Methods of Ethical Intervention
Following the "Minimum Intervention Principle" (proposed in this paper), adjustments to the development direction are only made through non-destructive and traceless methods:
- Technological guidance: Shielding key R&D information of dangerous technologies;
- Information implication: Conveying safety prompts through natural phenomena (e.g., stellar flickering, meteorite impacts);
- Resource regulation: Delivering pollution-free basic energy to reduce the risk of predatory resource development.

### 2.4 Definition of Key Concepts
1. Absolute Technological Asymmetry: Technological level difference ≥ 3 between civilizations, where low-level civilizations cannot perceive the existence and intervention of high-level civilizations;
2. Ethical Intervention: Focusing on protecting the right to independent evolution of low-level civilizations, without changing social structures, only fine-tuning technologies and development directions;
3. Stealth Observation: A traceless observation model without material/information interaction;
4. Minimum Intervention Principle: The intensity of intervention is limited to "eliminating risks" without additional impact on natural evolution.

## 3. Theoretical Comparison and Innovations
### 3.1 Differences from Traditional Extraterrestrial Contact Theories
| Theory Type         | Core View                      | Intervention Attitude | Quantification Level | Practical Adaptability       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Zoo Hypothesis       | High-level civilizations isolate low-level civilizations | Complete non-intervention | None                 | Ignoring civilizational development risks |
| Dark Forest Theory   | Civilizations destroy each other | Active attack         | None                 | Overemphasizing antagonism   |
| Intervention Threshold Theory | Limited intervention triggered by risk threshold | Ethical intervention | Quantitative model   | Consistent with ecological intervention logic |

### 3.2 Theoretical Innovations
1. Breaking the dichotomy: Proposing an intermediate path of "limited ethical intervention", more in line with the laws of complex system evolution;
2. Quantifying core indicators: Constructing a technological level system and intervention threshold formula to improve theoretical operability;
3. Clarifying ethical boundaries: Defining the "do's" and "don'ts" of intervention to avoid unrestrained intervention.

## 4. Practical Basis and Case Verification
### 4.1 Practical Basis: Intervention Logic of Human Civilization
Human intervention in ecosystems (such as endangered species protection and climate governance) follows the "risk threshold triggering" principle, consistent with the core logic of the Intervention Threshold Theory—intervention is only initiated when risks reach an irreversible level, and intervention methods follow the "minimum impact" principle.

### 4.2 Case Verification: TL-Ⅳ Civilization Intervening in TL-Ⅰ Civilization
Assume a TL-Ⅰ civilization initiates antimatter weapon R&D (DRV=0.9), EA=0.8, CIC=0.3. Substituting into the formula:

$$IT=2.4≥0.7$$

The high-level civilization initiates information implication intervention: simulating the explosion spectrum of antimatter weapons through stellar flickering to convey "technological destructiveness" information, and the low-level civilization ultimately abandons R&D, verifying the feasibility of the theory.

## 5. Discussion and Outlook
### 5.1 Theoretical Value
1. Improving the theoretical system of extraterrestrial contact: Filling the research gap in "limited intervention";
2. Providing quantitative analysis tools: The technological level system and intervention threshold formula can be directly applied to subsequent research;
3. Guiding the interstellar development of human civilization: Providing theoretical reference for human response to extraterrestrial contact.

### 5.2 Potential Controversies and Responses
1. Controversy: How to ensure the objectivity and fairness of high-level civilizations' ethical judgments? Response: Subsequent research will construct a multi-civilization collaborative intervention mechanism to reduce ethical biases of single civilizations through collective decision-making;
2. Controversy: Is it possible for low-level civilizations to perceive high-level intervention? Response: Under absolute technological asymmetry (level difference ≥ 3), high-level civilizations can achieve traceless intervention, which low-level civilizations cannot perceive through their own technologies.

### 5.3 Future Research Directions
1. Introducing time variables to construct a dynamic model of intervention threshold;
2. Designing a multi-civilization collaborative intervention mechanism to solve the ethical and cost issues of single-civilization intervention;
3. Modifying the quantitative model of the Cosmic Order Impact Coefficient (CIC) combined with astronomical observation data.

## 6. Conclusion
The "Cosmic Civilization Intervention Threshold" theory, based on technological asymmetry, clarifies the intervention threshold and implementation logic of high-level civilizations towards low-level civilizations through quantitative modeling, breaking the limitations of the dichotomy of traditional theories. The theory holds that the intervention behavior of cosmic civilizations is not "all or nothing", but limited ethical intervention based on risk thresholds, which both protects the right to independent evolution of low-level civilizations and maintains the stability of cosmic order. The research results provide a new theoretical framework and quantitative tools for the study of extraterrestrial civilization contact, as well as ideas for the interstellar development of human civilization.
