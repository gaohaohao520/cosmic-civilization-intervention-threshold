## Abstract
Based on the optimized Kardashev Scale model and ethical research on extraterrestrial civilization contact, this paper breaks through the binary opposition between the "Zoo Hypothesis" and the "Dark Forest Theory", and proposes the "Cosmic Civilization Intervention Threshold" theoretical framework with "technological asymmetry" as the premise and "ethical intervention" as the core. By quantifying the technological level of civilizations (Levels 0-Ⅶ) and defining the critical condition of "absolute technological asymmetry" (technological level difference ≥ 3), a static calculation formula for the intervention threshold $IT = \frac{DRV × EA}{CIC}$ is constructed, and the core logic of "stealth observation → threshold triggering → ethical intervention" is explained. This study fills the quantitative gap in the theory of extraterrestrial civilization intervention and provides a new analytical perspective for extraterrestrial civilization contact research.

## 1. Introduction
The theory of extraterrestrial civilization contact has long been dominated by two extreme views: "complete non-intervention" (e.g., the Zoo Hypothesis) and "destruction upon discovery" (e.g., the Dark Forest Theory), lacking quantitative and mechanistic research on "limited intervention". In reality, human civilization's intervention in ecosystems (such as species protection) follows the "risk criticality" principle—intervention is only initiated when the ecosystem faces irreversible damage, a logic that can be extended to the cosmic civilization scale.

Based on this, this paper proposes the "Cosmic Civilization Intervention Threshold" theory, which core addresses three questions: first, how technological asymmetry affects the feasibility of intervention; second, what the triggering critical conditions for intervention behavior are; third, the implementation principles and methods of ethical intervention. Through quantitative modeling and logical deduction, it provides a theoretical framework and quantitative basis for the intervention behavior of advanced civilizations on lower civilizations.

## 2. Core Theoretical Construction: Technological Asymmetry and Intervention Threshold
### 2.1 Technological Asymmetry: The Premise of Intervention
#### 2.1.1 Quantitative Optimization of Technological Levels
On the basis of the Kardashev Scale's classification of civilizations into Levels Ⅰ-Ⅲ, this paper optimizes it into a refined Level 0-Ⅶ system with "energy utilization efficiency", "space technology maturity", and "information processing capability" as core indicators:

| Technological Level | Core Characteristics | Energy Utilization Capability | Typical Technological Symbols |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| TL-0                | Planetary primitive civilization | Utilizes natural energy on planetary surface | Fire, tool making |
| TL-Ⅰ                | Planetary system civilization | Fully utilizes planetary energy | Controlled nuclear fusion, interplanetary navigation |
| TL-Ⅱ                | Stellar system civilization | Utilizes all stellar energy | Dyson Sphere, interstellar navigation |
| TL-Ⅲ                | Galactic civilization | Utilizes galactic core energy | Wormhole technology, intergalactic navigation |
| TL-Ⅳ and above      | Cosmic civilization | Utilizes cosmic space/dark energy | Spacetime curvature navigation, cosmic law modification |

#### 2.1.2 Critical Judgment of Absolute Technological Asymmetry
"Absolute technological asymmetry" is defined as a technological level difference of ≥ 3 between civilizations, at which point advanced civilizations can achieve:
- Stealth observation: Collect data without material/information interaction with lower civilizations through quantum entanglement detection and spacetime curvature fluctuation monitoring;
- Low-cost intervention: The marginal cost of intervention behavior approaches zero, such as shielding dangerous technology R&D information through spacetime curvature manipulation.

This critical value refers to the 200-year technological gap of human civilization (Industrial Revolution → Information Revolution) and the theoretical limit of quantum detection technology (Hossenfelder, 2020).

### 2.2 Intervention Threshold: The Quantitative Critical Point for Triggering Intervention
#### 2.2.1 Definition of Core Concepts
The Intervention Threshold (IT) is the critical condition for advanced civilizations to shift from "stealth observation" to "active ethical intervention", essentially the acceptable limit of development risks of lower civilizations, composed of three dimensions:
- Civilization Development Risk Value (DRV, 0-1): Covers risks of technological explosion, internal conflict, and interstellar exposure, assigned values using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Saaty, 1980);
- Ethical Acceptability (EA, 0-1): The matching degree between the ethical system of advanced civilizations and the development model of lower civilizations;
- Cosmic Order Impact Coefficient (CIC, 0-1): The impact of lower civilizations' development on cosmic order, with smaller CIC for lower levels (default 0.3 for TL-Ⅰ).

#### 2.2.2 Static Calculation Formula and Critical Value
$$IT = \frac{DRV × EA}{CIC}$$
- When $IT ≥ 0.7$: Initiate ethical intervention;
- When $IT < 0.7$: Maintain stealth observation.

The critical value is set with reference to the risk threshold of human civilization's intervention in ecosystems (IPCC, 2021).

### 2.3 Logical Chain of "Stealth Observation → Threshold Triggering → Ethical Intervention"
#### 2.3.1 Stealth Observation Phase
Advanced civilizations collect data of lower civilizations through a "non-contact detection system", with the core goal of dynamically monitoring DRV changes without interfering in their natural evolution.

#### 2.3.2 Typical Scenarios of Threshold Triggering
1. Technological explosion: Cross-level technological breakthrough in a short time (e.g., TL-Ⅰ civilization mastering antimatter weapons), DRV ≥ 0.8;
2. Civilizational internal strife: Global nuclear war or ecological disaster, with civilization survival risk ≥ 0.9;
3. Interstellar exposure: Active emission of high-power interstellar signals containing coordinates and technical details (Shostak, 2010).

#### 2.3.3 Implementation Principles and Methods of Ethical Intervention
Following the "Principle of Minimal Intervention" (proposed in this paper), intervention is only carried out through non-destructive and traceless means to adjust development direction:
- Technical guidance: Shield key R&D information of dangerous technologies;
- Information implication: Convey safety prompts through natural phenomena (stellar scintillation, meteorite impacts);
- Resource regulation: Deliver pollution-free basic energy to reduce the risk of predatory resource exploitation by lower civilizations.

### 2.4 Definition of Key Concepts
1. Absolute technological asymmetry: A technological level difference of ≥ 3 between civilizations, where lower civilizations cannot perceive the existence and intervention of advanced civilizations;
2. Ethical intervention: With the core of protecting the right to independent evolution of lower civilizations, it does not change social structures but only fine-tunes technology and development direction;
3. Stealth observation: A traceless observation mode with no material/information interaction with lower civilizations;
4. Principle of Minimal Intervention: The intensity of intervention is limited to "risk elimination" without additional impact on natural evolution.

## 3. Theoretical Comparison and Innovation Points
### 3.1 Differences from Traditional Extraterrestrial Civilization Contact Theories
| Theory Type         | Core View | Intervention Attitude | Quantification Level | Realistic Adaptability |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Zoo Hypothesis      | Advanced civilizations isolate lower civilizations | Complete non-intervention | None | Ignores civilization development risks |
| Dark Forest Theory  | Civilizations destroy each other | Active attack | None | Overemphasizes antagonism |
| Intervention Threshold Theory | Risk criticality triggers limited intervention | Ethical intervention | Quantitative model | Aligns with realistic logic of ecological intervention |

### 3.2 Theoretical Innovation Points
1. Breaking binary opposition: Proposing an intermediate path of "limited ethical intervention" that conforms to the evolution law of complex systems;
2. Quantifying core indicators: Constructing a technological level system and intervention threshold formula to improve theoretical operability;
3. Clarifying ethical boundaries: Defining the "permissible" and "impermissible" of intervention to avoid unconstrained intervention.
