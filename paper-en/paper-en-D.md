## Abstract
This paper applies the "Cosmic Civilization Intervention Threshold Theory" (Chapters A-C) to the development analysis of human civilization, evaluates the current intervention threshold risks faced by humans, and proposes the core development strategy of "technological-ethical collaborative evolution". By quantifying the Technological Level (TL-Ⅰb) and Civilization Ethical Index (CEI≈0.39) of human civilization, the intervention threshold is calculated as $IT=1.6≥0.7$, indicating that humans have entered the "ethical intervention observation list" of advanced civilizations. Three evolutionary scenarios are designed using the Scenario Analysis method, and the results show that "technological-ethical collaborative evolution" is the only path that can reduce the intervention risk to the "medium risk" level (IT=0.53 in 2100). The research provides theoretical guidance for the interstellar development of human civilization, extracts universal enlightenment for the evolution of cosmic civilizations, and improves the complete academic system of "theoretical construction-mechanism design-ethical constraint-practical application".

## 1. Introduction
The "Cosmic Civilization Intervention Threshold Theory" system constructed in Chapters A-C covers core theories, dynamic mechanisms and ethical constraints, but its ultimate value needs to be verified through practical application—as a typical TL-Ⅰb level low-level civilization, is human civilization facing the risk of intervention by advanced civilizations? How to avoid unnecessary intervention through its own development? This is not only the key to the landing of the theory but also an important proposition related to the survival of human civilization.

Currently, human civilization is facing multiple risks such as nuclear war, AI out-of-control and ecological disasters (IPCC, 2021), and is actively carrying out interstellar exploration (e.g., James Webb Space Telescope, Mars exploration). These behaviors may all affect the calculation of the intervention threshold. Based on this, this paper takes human civilization as the research object, evaluates the intervention risk and designs the development strategy, aiming to transform the theoretical achievements into practical guidance and provide reference for the evolution of other low-level civilizations.

## 2. Evaluation of the Intervention Threshold Risks of Human Civilization
### 2.1 Determination of the Technological Level and Ethical Index of Human Civilization
#### 2.1.1 Judgment of Technological Level (TL)
According to the technological level system in Chapter A, human civilization is currently at the **TL-Ⅰb level**, with core characteristics:
- Energy Utilization Efficiency: 45% (has not fully mastered planetary energy, controllable nuclear fusion is still in the experimental stage);
- Interstellar Exploration Capability: Solar system navigation (has achieved lunar landing and Mars exploration, but not interstellar navigation);
- Technological Stability: 70% (core technologies have ethical controversies and potential safety hazards, such as artificial intelligence and gene editing).

#### 2.1.2 Calculation of Civilization Ethical Index (CEI)
Using the CEI indicator system constructed in Chapter B, the calculation result by the Analytic Hierarchy Process is as follows:

| Primary Indicator | Indicator Value | Weight | Weighted Score |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------|----------------|
| Internal Cooperation Degree (IC) | 0.3             | 0.4    | 0.12           |
| Non-Violent Development Tendency (NVD) | 0.4             | 0.3    | 0.12           |
| Cosmic Responsibility Cognition (CRC) | 0.5             | 0.3    | 0.15           |
| **CEI Comprehensive Score** | -               | -      | **0.39**       |

CEI=0.39<0.6, indicating that human civilization is still in the "ethically immature" stage.

### 2.2 Calculation of the Intervention Threshold and Risk Level
Substitute into the static formula $IT = \frac{DRV × EA}{CIC}$ in Chapter A, set the parameters:
- $DRV=0.6$ (nuclear war risk 0.3 + AI out-of-control risk 0.2 + ecological disaster risk 0.1);
- $EA=0.8$ (refer to the average ethical acceptability of advanced civilizations to low-level civilizations from the Delphi survey);
- $CIC=0.3$ (human civilization's interstellar activities have not yet affected the cosmic order).

The calculation result is:
$$IT = \frac{0.6×0.8}{0.3} = 1.6 ≥ 0.7$$

According to the risk level division standard, human civilization is currently at the **high risk** level (IT>1.0), with an intervention probability >90%, and has entered the "ethical intervention observation list" of advanced civilizations.

### 2.3 Risk Level Division Standards
| Risk Level | IT Value Range | Intervention Probability | Response Strategy |
|------------|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Low Risk   | <0.5           | <10%                    | Maintain the existing development model and strengthen interstellar observation |
| Medium Risk | 0.5-0.7        | 10%-50%                 | Optimize the development strategy and reduce key risks |
| High Risk  | 0.7-1.0        | 50%-90%                 | Urgently adjust the development direction and initiate ethical upgrading |
| Extremely High Risk | >1.0    | >90%                    | Fully implement the technological-ethical collaborative strategy to avoid intervention triggering |

## 3. The "Technological-Ethical Collaborative Evolution" Development Strategy
### 3.1 Core Strategic Goals
- Short-term (2025-2100): Increase CEI to 0.6, reduce DRV to 0.4, IT=0.53 (medium risk), and withdraw from the intervention observation list;
- Medium-term (2101-2200): Upgrade the technological level to TL-Ⅰc, CEI≥0.7, becoming an "ethically mature civilization";
- Long-term (2201-2500): Break through the technological level to TL-Ⅱ, CEI≥0.8, and have the qualification to participate in multi-civilization collaborative intervention.

### 3.2 Strategic Implementation Paths
#### 3.2.1 Ethical Constraints on Technological Development
1. Establish a "Ethical Review Mechanism for Dangerous Technologies": Led by the United Nations, set up a "Extraterrestrial Civilization Technology Ethics Committee" to review dangerous technologies such as strong artificial intelligence and antimatter weapons, and prohibit unregulated R&D;
2. Prioritize the development of "cosmic-friendly technologies": Focus on R&D of controllable nuclear fusion, interstellar communication and ecological restoration technologies to reduce DRV values;
3. Technological Diffusion Control: Implement international control over sensitive technologies (e.g., nuclear technology, artificial intelligence) to avoid technology abuse.

#### 3.2.2 Interstellar Upgrading of the Ethical System
1. Construct a "Cosmic Responsibility Ethical System": Incorporate "protecting cosmic order" and "respecting extraterrestrial civilizations" into human ethical norms to improve CRC values;
2. Strengthen Global Cooperation: Promote the reform of the United Nations, establish a global governance system, and improve IC values (target: IC≥0.6 by 2100);
3. Reduce Violent Conflicts: Restrict the development of military technology through international treaties and improve NVD values (target: NVD≥0.7 by 2100).

#### 3.2.3 Rational Control of Interstellar Exposure
1. Cautious Launch of Interstellar Signals: Suspend the launch of high-power directional interstellar signals and only retain low-power scientific detection signals;
2. Priority to Passive Observation: Use China's FAST and the US James Webb Space Telescope for passive observation to prioritize understanding the distribution and rules of cosmic civilizations;
3. Establish an Interstellar Exposure Early Warning Mechanism: Monitor abnormal signals from the universe and make early response preparations.

## 4. Scenario Analysis of Human Civilization Evolution
Three evolutionary scenarios are designed using the Scenario Analysis method to simulate the development status of human civilization in 2100:

| Scenario Type | Core Characteristics | CEI Value | DRV Value | IT Value | Intervention Risk Level | Feasibility |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------------------|-------------|
| Technology-First | One-sided pursuit of technological breakthroughs, ignoring ethical construction | 0.3       | 0.8       | 2.13     | Extremely High Risk     | Low (prone to trigger intervention) |
| Ethics-First | Overemphasizing ethical constraints and restricting technological development | 0.6       | 0.5       | 0.8      | High Risk               | Medium (technological backwardness is easy to be eliminated) |
| Collaborative Evolution | Synchronous advancement of technological development and ethical construction | 0.6       | 0.4
