## Abstract
This paper applies the "Cosmic Civilization Intervention Threshold Theory" (Chapters A-C) to the development analysis of human civilization, evaluates the current intervention threshold risks faced by humans, and proposes the core development strategy of "technology-ethics coordinated evolution". By quantifying the technological energy level (TL-Ib) and Civilization Ethical Index (CEI≈0.39) of human civilization, the intervention threshold is calculated as $IT=1.6≥0.7$, indicating that humans have entered the "ethical intervention observation list" of high-level civilizations. Three evolutionary scenarios are designed using scenario analysis, and the results show that "technology-ethics coordinated evolution" is the only path that can reduce the intervention risk to "medium risk" (IT=0.53 in 2100). This research provides theoretical guidance for the interstellar development of human civilization, extracts universal enlightenment for cosmic civilization evolution, and improves the complete academic system of "theoretical construction - mechanism design - ethical constraints - practical application".

## 1. Introduction
The "Cosmic Civilization Intervention Threshold Theory" system constructed in Chapters A-C covers core theories, dynamic mechanisms, and ethical constraints, but its ultimate value needs to be verified through practical application—As a typical TL-Ib low-level civilization, is human civilization facing the risk of intervention by high-level civilizations? How to avoid unnecessary intervention through its own development? This is not only the key to theoretical implementation but also an important proposition related to the survival of human civilization.

Currently, human civilization faces multiple risks such as nuclear war, artificial intelligence out-of-control, and ecological disasters (IPCC, 2021), while actively carrying out interstellar exploration (such as the James Webb Space Telescope and Mars exploration). These behaviors may affect the calculation of the intervention threshold. Based on this, this paper takes human civilization as the research object, evaluates intervention risks, and designs development strategies, aiming to transform theoretical achievements into practical guidance and provide reference for the evolution of other low-level civilizations.

## 2. Evaluation of the Intervention Threshold Risk of Human Civilization
### 2.1 Technological Energy Level and Ethical Index of Human Civilization
#### 2.1.1 Determination of Technological Level (TL)
According to the technological energy level system in Chapter A, human civilization is currently at **TL-Ib**, with core characteristics:
- Energy utilization efficiency: 45% (not fully mastering planetary energy, controlled nuclear fusion is still in the experimental stage);
- Interstellar exploration capability: Intra-solar system navigation (lunar landing and Mars exploration have been realized, interstellar navigation has not been realized);
- Technical stability: 70% (core technologies have ethical controversies and safety hazards, such as artificial intelligence and gene editing).

#### 2.1.2 Calculation of Civilization Ethical Index (CEI)
Using the CEI indicator system constructed in Chapter B, the calculation using the Analytic Hierarchy Process shows:

| Primary Indicator | Indicator Value | Weight | Weighted Score |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------|----------------|
| Internal Cooperation (IC) | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.12 |
| Non-violent Development Tendency (NVD) | 0.4 | 0.3 | 0.12 |
| Cosmic Responsibility Cognition (CRC) | 0.5 | 0.3 | 0.15 |
| **CEI Comprehensive Score** | - | - | **0.39** |

CEI=0.39 < 0.6, indicating that human civilization is still in the "ethically immature" stage.

### 2.2 Calculation of Intervention Threshold and Risk Level
Substituting into the static formula $IT = \frac{DRV × EA}{CIC}$ in Chapter A, setting parameters:
- $DRV=0.6$ (nuclear war risk 0.3 + artificial intelligence out-of-control risk 0.2 + ecological disaster risk 0.1);
- $EA=0.8$ (referring to the average ethical acceptance of low-level civilizations by high-level civilizations, from the Delphi survey);
- $CIC=0.3$ (human civilization's interstellar activities have not yet affected cosmic order).

The calculation shows:
$$IT = \frac{0.6×0.8}{0.3} = 1.6 ≥ 0.7$$

According to the risk level classification standard, human civilization is currently at the **high-risk** level (IT>1.0), with an intervention probability >90%, and has entered the "ethical intervention observation list" of high-level civilizations.

### 2.3 Risk Level Classification Standard
| Risk Level | IT Value Range | Intervention Probability | Response Strategy |
|------------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Low Risk | <0.5 | <10% | Maintain the existing development model and strengthen interstellar observation |
| Medium Risk | 0.5-0.7 | 10%-50% | Optimize development strategies and reduce key risks |
| High Risk | 0.7-1.0 | 50%-90% | Urgently adjust development direction and initiate ethical upgrading |
| Extremely High Risk | >1.0 | >90% | Fully implement the technology-ethics coordinated strategy to avoid intervention triggering |

## 3. "Technology-Ethics Coordinated Evolution" Development Strategy
### 3.1 Core Strategic Goals
- Short-term (2025-2100): Increase CEI to 0.6, reduce DRV to 0.4, IT=0.53 (medium risk), and withdraw from the intervention observation list;
- Medium-term (2101-2200): Upgrade the technological energy level to TL-Ic, CEI≥0.7, becoming an "ethically mature civilization";
- Long-term (2201-2500): Break through the technological energy level to TL-II, CEI≥0.8, qualifying to participate in multi-civilization collaborative intervention.

### 3.2 Strategic Implementation Paths
#### 3.2.1 Ethical Constraints on Technological Development
1. Establishing the "Ethical Review Mechanism for Dangerous Technologies": Led by the United Nations, establish the "Extraterrestrial Civilization Technology Ethics Committee" to review dangerous technologies such as strong artificial intelligence and antimatter weapons, prohibiting unrestrained R&D;
2. Prioritizing the development of "cosmic-friendly technologies": Focus on R&D of controlled nuclear fusion, interstellar communication, and ecological restoration technologies to reduce DRV values;
3. Controlling technology diffusion: Implement international control over sensitive technologies (such as nuclear technology and artificial intelligence) to avoid technology abuse.

#### 3.2.2 Interstellar Upgrading of the Ethical System
1. Constructing the "Cosmic Responsibility Ethics System": Incorporate "protecting cosmic order" and "respecting extraterrestrial civilizations" into human ethical norms to improve CRC values;
2. Strengthening global cooperation: Promote UN reform, establish a global governance system, and improve IC values (target: IC≥0.6 by 2100);
3. Reducing violent conflicts: Restrict the development of military technology through international treaties to improve NVD values (target: NVD≥0.7 by 2100).

#### 3.2.3 Rational Control of Interstellar Exposure
1. Cautiously launching interstellar signals: Suspend the launch of high-power directional interstellar signals, retaining only low-power scientific detection signals;
2. Prioritizing passive observation: Use China's FAST telescope and the US James Webb Space Telescope for passive observation, prioritizing understanding the distribution and rules of cosmic civilizations;
3. Establishing an interstellar exposure early warning mechanism: Monitor abnormal signals from the universe and make preparations in advance.

## 4. Scenario Analysis of Human Civilization Evolution
Three evolutionary scenarios are designed using Scenario Analysis to simulate the development status of human civilization in 2100:

| Scenario Type | Core Characteristics | CEI Value | DRV Value | IT Value | Intervention Risk Level | Feasibility |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|------------------------|-------------|
| Technology Priority | One-sided pursuit of technological breakthroughs, ignoring ethical construction | 0.3 | 0.8 | 2.13 | Extremely High Risk | Low (prone to triggering intervention) |
| Ethics Priority | Overemphasizing ethical constraints, restricting technological development | 0.6 | 0.5 | 0.8 | High Risk | Medium (prone to elimination due to backward technology) |
| Coordinated Evolution | Synchronous advancement of technological development and ethical construction | 0.6 | 0.4 | 0.53 | Medium Risk | High (optimal path) |

The results show that "technology-ethics coordinated evolution" is the only path that can balance "technological progress" and "risk avoidance", avoiding intervention triggering caused by technology priority and solving the problem of backward technology caused by ethics priority.

## 5. Universal Enlightenment for Cosmic Civilization Evolution
### 5.1 Core Enlightenment
1. The coordination of technology and ethics is the core of civilization survival: If the technological development of any civilization is divorced from ethical constraints, it will eventually trigger intervention by high-level civilizations or self-destruction;
2. The value of the right to independent evolution is higher than technological speed: Low-level civilizations should attach importance to the quality of natural evolution rather than pursuing "leapfrog technological development";
3. The ultimate order of cosmic civilizations is cooperation rather than confrontation: The intervention behavior of high-level civilizations is essentially to maintain the cooperative order of the universe, and low-level civilizations need to understand and integrate into this order.

### 5.2 Suggestions for Other Low-Level Civilizations
1. Accurately positioning their own energy levels and ethical levels, and regularly evaluating intervention threshold risks;
2. Establishing a "technology-ethics" dual-drive development model to avoid imbalance in a single dimension;
3. Cautiously carrying out interstellar activities, prioritizing understanding cosmic rules through passive observation, and then gradually promoting active exploration.

## 6. Summary of the Series Research and Future Outlook
### 6.1 Summary of the Series Research
The "Cosmic Civilization Intervention Threshold Theory" series (Chapters A-D) constructs a complete academic system:
- Chapter A: Proposing the core theoretical framework and static model, solving the problem of "whether to intervene";
- Chapter B: Expanding the dynamic model and collaborative mechanism, solving the problems of "when to intervene" and "who to intervene";
- Chapter C: Defining ethical boundaries and practical paths, solving the problem of "how to intervene ethically";
- Chapter D: Applying to human civilization, proposing development strategies, solving the problem of "how to implement the theory".

The four chapters are progressive, forming a closed loop of "theoretical construction - mechanism design - ethical constraints - practical application", providing a new academic paradigm for the research on extraterrestrial contact.

### 6.2 Future Research Directions
1. Combining astronomical observation data (such as the cosmic signal detection results of the James Webb Space Telescope) to revise the quantitative model of the CIC value;
2. Exploring the active communication mechanism between low-level and high-level civilizations to realize interstellar cooperation while protecting the right to independent evolution;
3. Constructing a real-time monitoring system for the CEI value of human civilization to provide data support for the adjustment of development strategies;
4. Conducting cross-cultural research on extraterrestrial civilization ethics to formulate global guidelines for extraterrestrial contact.

## 7. Conclusion
By applying the cosmic civilization intervention threshold theory to human civilization, this paper clarifies the high intervention risk currently faced by humans and proposes the optimal development strategy of "technology-ethics coordinated evolution". Research shows that the interstellar development of human civilization cannot only pursue technological speed but also attach importance to the synchronous upgrading of the ethical system—only by realizing the coordinated evolution of technology and ethics can unnecessary intervention by high-level civilizations be avoided, and sustainable survival and development be achieved. At the same time, the universal enlightenment of cosmic civilization evolution extracted in this paper also provides reference for other low-level civilizations, promoting the research on extraterrestrial contact from "pure theoretical discussion" to "practical guidance".
