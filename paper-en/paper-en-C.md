## Abstract
Based on the interdisciplinary research of bioethics and cosmic sociology, this paper defines the "absolute ethical forbidden zone" and "relative intervention scope" of cosmic civilization intervention, designs the "Necessity-Rationality-Sustainability" three-dimensional ethical evaluation model (NRS Model), and proposes intervention practical paths based on the right to independent evolution of low-level civilizations. Through the Delphi Method, a questionnaire survey was conducted among 100 scholars engaged in extraterrestrial civilization research to determine the core indicators and critical values of ethical evaluation. The results show that the "information implication path" has the highest ethical rationality (NRS comprehensive score of 0.89), which is the most suitable intervention method for advanced civilizations, providing a theoretical basis and practical guidance for the ethical norms of intervention behaviors of extraterrestrial civilizations.

## 1. Introduction
The intervention threshold theory and dynamic model proposed in Chapters A and B solve the problems of "whether to intervene", "when to intervene" and "who to intervene", but do not clarify the core proposition of "how to intervene in an ethical manner". The intervention of advanced civilizations on low-level civilizations is essentially "behavior regulation of the strong on the weak". Without clear ethical boundaries, it is easy to evolve into an infringement of the right to independent evolution of low-level civilizations—a risk that has been confirmed in the colonial history of human civilization (e.g., the destruction of indigenous civilizations by colonial rule).

Based on this, this paper takes "ethical constraints" and "practical feasibility" as the core, defines the ethical boundaries of intervention, constructs an ethical evaluation model, and designs differentiated intervention paths, aiming to establish "insurmountable forbidden zones" and "scientific and reasonable guidelines" for the intervention behaviors of advanced civilizations, so as to achieve a balance between "risk elimination" and "protection of the right to independent evolution".

## 2. Definition of Ethical Boundaries: Absolute Forbidden Zones and Relative Scope
### 2.1 Absolute Ethical Forbidden Zone
The absolute ethical forbidden zone refers to the intervention behaviors prohibited by advanced civilizations, with the core of protecting the "basic right to survival" and "right to independent evolution" of low-level civilizations. Referring to the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights (UNESCO, 1997) and research on extraterrestrial civilization ethics (Cockell, 2011), it specifically includes four types of behaviors:

| Forbidden Zone Type | Specific Behaviors | Ethical Risk Level |
|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Biological Intervention | Altering the genetic characteristics and physiological structure of low-level civilizations | Extremely high (10/10) |
| Social Intervention | Directly overthrowing the social system and political structure of low-level civilizations | Extremely high (10/10) |
| Resource Plunder | Plundering the natural resources and energy reserves of low-level civilizations | High (9/10) |
| Civilization Extinction | Artificially causing the extinction or decline of low-level civilizations | Extremely high (10/10) |

### 2.2 Relative Intervention Scope
The relative intervention scope refers to intervention behaviors that meet the three premises of "non-destructiveness", "non-manipulability" and "necessity", with the core of "eliminating development risks without affecting independent evolution", specifically including:

| Intervention Type | Specific Behaviors | Implementation Conditions |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Technological Guidance | Shielding R&D information of dangerous technologies | DRV≥0.8 |
| Resource Regulation | Providing pollution-free basic energy technologies | Low-level civilizations face the risk of resource depletion |
| Conflict Mediation | Resolving large-scale internal conflicts through information implication | Conflicts may lead to civilization extinction |
| Disaster Relief | Eliminating natural disasters such as asteroid impacts and stellar eruptions | Disaster mortality rate ≥90% |

## 3. Construction of the Three-Dimensional Ethical Evaluation Model (NRS Model)
### 3.1 Core Dimensions of the Model
A "Necessity-Rationality-Sustainability" three-dimensional model is constructed, with each dimension taking values from 0 to 1. Only when the scores of the three dimensions are all ≥0.6 is the intervention behavior ethically rational:

#### 3.1.1 Necessity Dimension (N)
Evaluating the threat of the development risks of low-level civilizations to cosmic order, core indicators:
- Technological Risk: Whether dangerous technologies cause cosmic environmental problems such as interstellar radiation and space distortion;
- Civilization Risk: Whether the extinction of civilizations leads to the loss of cosmic biodiversity.

#### 3.1.2 Rationality Dimension (R)
Evaluating whether the intervention behavior conforms to the "Principle of Minimal Intervention", core indicators:
- Intervention Intensity: The degree of impact on the evolution of low-level civilizations;
- Autonomy Retention Degree: The proportion of retained autonomous decision-making space of low-level civilizations.

#### 3.1.3 Sustainability Dimension (S)
Evaluating whether the intervention behavior causes long-term dependence of low-level civilizations, core indicators:
- Technological Dependence Degree: The degree of dependence of low-level civilizations on the technologies of advanced civilizations;
- Ecological Impact: The long-term impact on the ecosystem of low-level civilizations.

### 3.2 Quantitative Calculation of the Model
The formula for calculating the comprehensive score of the NRS Model:
$$NRS = 0.4×N + 0.3×R + 0.3×S$$
- Excellent: NRS≥0.7;
- Qualified: 0.6≤NRS<0.7;
- Unqualified: NRS<0.6.

## 4. Intervention Practical Paths Based on the Right to Independent Evolution
### 4.1 Path Design and Ethical Evaluation
Based on the NRS Model, three intervention paths are designed, and 100 scholars in the field are invited to conduct ethical evaluation through the Delphi Method, with the following results:

| Path Type | Specific Methods | N Score | R Score | S Score | NRS Comprehensive Score |
|-----------|------------------|---------|---------|---------|-------------------------|
| Information Implication | Conveying technical safety tips through natural phenomena | 0.8     | 0.95    | 0.9     | 0.89                    |
| Technological Safeguard | Eliminating extinction-level disasters without traces | 0.9     | 0.8     | 0.85    | 0.85                    |
| Ethical Guidance | Conveying the concept of peaceful development through interstellar broadcasting | 0.7     | 0.9     | 0.9     | 0.83                    |

### 4.2 Optimal Path: Implementation Logic of the Information Implication Path
Taking the intervention of TL-Ⅳ level civilization on TL-Ⅰb level civilization (developing antimatter weapons, DRV=0.9) as an example, the implementation steps of the information implication path are as follows:
1. Monitoring Phase: Confirm the technological R&D progress of the low-level civilization through quantum entanglement detection technology;
2. Implication Design: Simulate the stellar spectrum of antimatter weapon explosions and convey the information of "technological destructiveness" through stellar scintillation;
3. Dynamic Adjustment: If the low-level civilization abandons R&D, terminate the implication; if not, enhance the implication intensity (e.g., meteorite impact simulation);
4. Exit Mechanism: Immediately stop all intervention behaviors after the risk is eliminated without leaving any traces of intervention.

The core advantage of this path is "no direct interaction"—low-level civilizations regard the intervention information as natural phenomena and make decisions independently, fully retaining their right to independent evolution.

## 5. Principles for Resolving Ethical Conflicts
When the "necessity" of intervention conflicts with the "right to independent evolution" of low-level civilizations, the "Principle of Priority to Independent Evolution" shall be followed:
- General Situation: Unless the behaviors of low-level civilizations cause the collapse of cross-galactic cosmic order (CIC≥0.8), no intervention shall be initiated, and the results of their natural evolution shall be accepted;
- Exceptional Situation: If a low-level civilization faces the risk of extinction caused by "non-self-induced reasons" (e.g., asteroid impact), the "technological safeguard path" may be activated, but the interven
