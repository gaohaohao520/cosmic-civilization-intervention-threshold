## Abstract
Based on the interdisciplinary research of bioethics and cosmic sociology, this paper defines the "absolute ethical forbidden zones" and "relative intervention scope" of cosmic civilization intervention, designs the "Necessity-Rationality-Sustainability" three-dimensional ethical evaluation model (NRS Model), and proposes practical intervention paths based on the right to independent evolution of low-level civilizations. Through the Delphi Method, questionnaires were conducted among 100 scholars researching extraterrestrial civilizations to determine the core indicators and critical values of ethical evaluation. The results show that the "information implication path" has the highest ethical rationality (NRS comprehensive score 0.89), which is the most suitable intervention method for high-level civilizations, providing a theoretical basis and practical guidance for the ethical norms of extraterrestrial civilization intervention behaviors.

## 1. Introduction
The intervention threshold theory and dynamic model proposed in Chapters A and B solve the problems of "whether to intervene", "when to intervene", and "who will intervene", but fail to clarify the core proposition of "how to intervene ethically". The intervention of high-level civilizations in low-level civilizations is essentially "behavioral regulation of the strong over the weak". Without clear ethical boundaries, it is likely to evolve into an infringement of the right to independent evolution of low-level civilizations—a risk that has been confirmed in the colonial history of human civilization (such as the destruction of indigenous civilizations by colonial rule).

Based on this, this paper focuses on "ethical constraints" and "practical feasibility", defines the ethical boundaries of intervention, constructs an ethical evaluation model, and designs differentiated intervention paths, aiming to establish "insurmountable forbidden zones" and "scientific and reasonable guidelines" for the intervention behaviors of high-level civilizations, realizing the balance between "risk elimination" and "protection of the right to independent evolution".

## 2. Definition of Ethical Boundaries: Absolute Forbidden Zones and Relative Scope
### 2.1 Absolute Ethical Forbidden Zones
Absolute ethical forbidden zones are intervention behaviors prohibited by high-level civilizations, focusing on protecting the "basic right to survival" and "right to independent evolution" of low-level civilizations. Referring to the "Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights" (UNESCO, 1997) and research on extraterrestrial civilization ethics (Cockell, 2011), they specifically include four types of behaviors:

| Forbidden Zone Type | Specific Behaviors | Ethical Risk Level |
|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Biological Intervention | Altering the genetic characteristics and physiological structures of low-level civilizations | Extremely High (10/10) |
| Social Intervention | Directly overthrowing the social systems and political structures of low-level civilizations | Extremely High (10/10) |
| Resource Plundering | Plundering the natural resources and energy reserves of low-level civilizations | High (9/10) |
| Civilization Extinction | Artificially causing the extinction or decline of low-level civilizations | Extremely High (10/10) |

### 2.2 Relative Intervention Scope
Relative intervention scope refers to intervention behaviors that meet the three prerequisites of "non-destructiveness", "non-manipulation", and "necessity", focusing on "eliminating development risks without affecting independent evolution", specifically including:

| Intervention Type | Specific Behaviors | Implementation Conditions |
|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Technological Guidance | Shielding R&D information of dangerous technologies | DRV≥0.8 |
| Resource Regulation | Providing pollution-free basic energy technologies | Low-level civilizations face resource depletion risks |
| Conflict Mediation | Resolving large-scale internal conflicts through information implication | Conflicts may lead to civilization extinction |
| Disaster Relief | Eliminating natural disasters such as asteroid impacts and stellar eruptions | Disaster mortality rate ≥90% |

## 3. Construction of the Three-Dimensional Ethical Evaluation Model (NRS Model)
### 3.1 Core Dimensions of the Model
Construct a "Necessity-Rationality-Sustainability" three-dimensional model, with each dimension taking values between 0-1. Intervention behaviors are only ethically reasonable if all three dimensions score ≥0.6:

#### 3.1.1 Necessity Dimension (N)
Evaluating the threat of low-level civilizations' development risks to cosmic order, with core indicators:
- Technological risk: Whether dangerous technologies of low-level civilizations will trigger cosmic environmental problems such as interstellar radiation and spatial distortion;
- Civilizational risk: Whether the extinction of low-level civilizations will lead to the loss of cosmic biodiversity.

#### 3.1.2 Rationality Dimension (R)
Evaluating whether intervention behaviors conform to the "Minimum Intervention Principle", with core indicators:
- Intervention intensity: The degree of impact of intervention behaviors on the evolution of low-level civilizations;
- Autonomy retention: The proportion of independent decision-making space retained by low-level civilizations.

#### 3.1.3 Sustainability Dimension (S)
Evaluating whether intervention behaviors will cause long-term dependence of low-level civilizations, with core indicators:
- Technological dependence: The degree of dependence of low-level civilizations on the technologies of high-level civilizations;
- Ecological impact: The long-term impact on the ecosystem of low-level civilizations.

### 3.2 Quantitative Calculation of the Model
The comprehensive score calculation formula of the NRS Model:
$$NRS = 0.4×N + 0.3×R + 0.3×S$$
- Excellent: NRS≥0.7;
- Qualified: 0.6≤NRS<0.7;
- Unqualified: NRS<0.6.

## 4. Practical Intervention Paths Based on the Right to Independent Evolution
### 4.1 Path Design and Ethical Evaluation
Based on the NRS Model, three intervention paths are designed, and ethical evaluation is conducted by inviting 100 field scholars through the Delphi Method. The results are as follows:

| Path Type | Specific Methods | N Score | R Score | S Score | NRS Comprehensive Score |
|-----------|------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------------------------|
| Information Implication | Conveying technical safety prompts through natural phenomena | 0.8 | 0.95 | 0.9 | 0.89 |
| Technical Guarantee | Traceless elimination of existential disasters | 0.9 | 0.8 | 0.85 | 0.85 |
| Ethical Guidance | Disseminating peaceful development concepts through interstellar broadcasting | 0.7 | 0.9 | 0.9 | 0.83 |

### 4.2 Optimal Path: Implementation Logic of the Information Implication Path
Taking TL-Ⅳ civilizations intervening in TL-Ⅰb civilizations (developing antimatter weapons, DRV=0.9) as an example, the implementation steps of the information implication path are:
1. Monitoring phase: Confirming the technical R&D progress of low-level civilizations through quantum entanglement detection technology;
2. Implication design: Simulating the stellar spectrum of antimatter weapon explosions, conveying "technological destructiveness" information through stellar flickering;
3. Dynamic adjustment: Terminating the implication if the low-level civilization abandons R&D; enhancing the implication intensity (such as meteorite impact simulation) if not;
4. Exit mechanism: Immediately stopping all intervention behaviors after risk elimination, leaving no intervention traces.

The core advantage of this path is "no direct interaction"—low-level civilizations regard intervention information as natural phenomena, make independent decisions, and fully retain their right to independent evolution.

## 5. Principles for Resolving Ethical Conflicts
When there is a conflict between the "necessity" of intervention and the "right to independent evolution" of low-level civilizations, the "Principle of Priority to Independent Evolution" is followed:
- General situation: Unless the behaviors of low-level civilizations will trigger cross-galactic cosmic order collapse (CIC≥0.8), no intervention is initiated, and the results of their natural evolution are accepted;
- Exceptional situation: If low-level civilizations face "existential risks not caused by themselves" (such as asteroid impacts), the "technical guarantee path" can be activated, but intervention must be withdrawn immediately after risk elimination, without intervening in subsequent development.

This principle refers to the "Principle of Priority to Nature" in biodiversity conservation (CBD, 2010), balancing the maintenance of cosmic order and the protection of the right to independent evolution of low-level civilizations.

## 6. Discussion and Outlook
### 6.1 Theoretical Value
1. Filling the ethical gap: Clarifying the "do's" and "don'ts" of cosmic civilization intervention, providing ethical norms for intervention behaviors;
2. Quantitative ethical evaluation: The NRS Model realizes the accurate quantification of the ethical rationality of intervention behaviors, improving theoretical operability;
3. Practical path guidance: The information implication path provides a low-risk and high-ethical intervention plan for high-level civilizations.

### 6.2 Potential Controversies and Responses
1. Controversy: How to define the standard for "cross-galactic cosmic order collapse"? Response: Subsequent research will combine cosmic physics data to construct a dynamic evaluation system for CIC values and clarify critical standards;
2. Controversy: Whether information implication may be misunderstood by low-level civilizations, leading to secondary risks? Response: High-level civilizations can reduce the probability of misunderstanding through "multi-channel implication verification" (such as stellar flickering + meteorite signals), while monitoring the civilizational response after implication and adjusting strategies in a timely manner.

### 6.3 Future Research Directions
1. Conducting cross-cultural ethical research: Analyzing the differences in ethical systems of different types of civilizations and optimizing the indicator weights of the NRS Model;
2. Constructing a risk early warning mechanism for intervention behaviors: Identifying potential secondary risks caused by intervention in advance;
3. Exploring the acceptance model of low-level civilizations towards ethical intervention: Providing a basis for the personalized adjustment of intervention paths.

## 7. Conclusion
The ethical boundaries of cosmic civilization intervention, the constructed NRS three-dimensional evaluation model, and the proposed information implication path jointly constitute a complete system of "ethical constraints - quantitative evaluation - practical guidance". Research shows that the intervention behaviors of high-level civilizations must focus on "protecting the right to independent evolution of low-level civilizations", follow the principles of "minimum intervention" and "no direct interaction", delineate forbidden zones through ethical boundaries, quantify rationality through evaluation models, and ensure feasibility through practical paths, realizing the dual goals of "risk elimination" and "ethical compliance". This conclusion not only improves the ethical dimension of the cosmic civilization intervention threshold theory but also provides ethical references for human civilization to respond to extraterrestrial contact.
